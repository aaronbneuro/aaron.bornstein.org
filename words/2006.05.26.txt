in commemoration of our thingfest and all such early-year cleansing
rituals, i present my favorite new-to-me words of the first third and
change of 2006:


    gyrovague: A monk who travels from one place to another.
    anabiosis: A return to life after death or apparent death.
    bombinate: to buzz, hum, or drone.


use passionately (but sparingly).
