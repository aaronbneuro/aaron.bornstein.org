SIX (seis) MONTHS OF WORDS, for the dates o6.o1.2o1o - 12.31.2o1o

HERE YOU ARE, belatedly and without further...

STOP THE WORDPRESSES!  I _may_ have been going about this *all wrong.*
 For years now, I've been pronouncing `neologism' as though it were of
two distinct but co-dependent sub-parts, a lexical voltron, if you
will.  I would independently enunciate `neo' (as in keanu's star
turn), and logism (sounds like "low-" ...)

   BUT, my uncle Vinny, an author and a man of some esteem in matters
of wordsmanship,  had independently investigated thispronunciation
some years ago, and discovered to his continued befuddlement that,
according to merriam-webster, the OED, and the american heritage
dictionary, there are TWO "valid" ways to pronounce the word that is
very crucial to this here email series:

1. nee-ALA-jizm, as though it were a field of study.
2. NIH-ala-jizm, as in I don't believe in this word.

If neologism is pronounced this way, then neotomelogism sounds like a
very painful surgery where they remove something ... Wait... What's
the word for a surgery where you remove something? Somethingectomy??

Well, it turns out you can just say 'ectomy.'  (Thanks, Pre-Dr.
Alaina.  )  As in, I want to perform an ectomy on the OED; I don't
care what I take out... as long as it hurts.

Well, at least that's resolved.  And, to soothe my frustration over
l'affaire neologism, this past half-year gave me the word with the
most comprehensively wonderful definition I have ever heard:
poshlost.  Read it and tell me if you don't feel the same.  But also
tell me if you ado...


NEOTOMELOGISMS (i invented this word, i can pronounce it however i wish):
::: callipygian: having shapely buttocks (etymology: greek kallipygos,
yet only circa 1800!) [via peretz, in a rather unfortunate set of
circumstances]
::: estival: Relating to or occurring in summer.
::: pareidolia: finding images or sounds in random phenomena [via star s.]
::: plaatsvervangende schaamte (dutch): shame in the place of another
[via fenna, not pronounced in any way you might imagine]
::: horripilate: to produce a bristling of the hair on the skin from
cold, fear, etc.; goose flesh. [very very fun to try inventing
re-pronunciations of this, out loud]
::: scariose: Thin, membranous, and dry: scarious bracts; a scarious
tongue. [thanks to fenna; i played it against her in scrabble for a
double triple word score]
::: Davka (hebrew/yiddish): It literally means "exactly in this way
and in no other way" and is used more loosely to emphasize the irony
of a situation.
    eg: "So I'm allergic to shellfish so where do they bring me to
dinner? Davka to the king crab, lobster and scallops buffet."
          "And davka to my mother I accidentally forwarded the naked pictures."
    [via anya "famous for her words" k]
::: sangha: sanskrit synonym for chevre, from last semester's email
[via anya the k, *again*]

and, my new favorite definition:

::: poshlost: (russian) self-satisfied mediocrity... somewhere between
banality & evil.  searching the internet for definitions to this word
is *extremely* entertaining.  I leave this as an exercise to the
reader, but here is one of my favorite embellishments: "banality, with
a characteristic national flavoring of metaphysics and high morality,
and a peculiar conjunction of the sexual and the spiritual."


NOVELOGISMS (this one actually sounds kinda cool with the new
pronunciation options):
::: nom-power: person/days of edible items ("X supplies required to
feed about 100 ppl for 6 days --> 600 nom-power") [via danbee t.t.
kim]
::: poshlust: the positive, aspirational, complement to poshlost
[coined by amy l.]
::: antequotidian: before [it|you|they|life] got boring. [coined by
me, challenged by several]
::: exferring: deducing in general or about the whole (c.f. inferring)
[coined by me]
propaedeutics (noun) - the preliminary body of knowledge and rules
necessary for the study of some art or science.
::: hypobole (an underexaggeration) [coined by nathan w., challenged
by urban dictionary]
::: ehtheism: putting agonistics in their rightful place on the theism
continuum [me again]
::: obseveration: (from perseveration) repetition of a particular
conceptual fixation, without repeating any particular action [<-- this
guy!]
::: observeration: staring

LACKINGLOGISMS (appropriately, i don't even know where to go with
pronouncing this):

::: a word that sounds the same forward and backward but is not
spelled the same forward and backward.  homodrome?  sonodrome?  also,
examples of such a word (invent one if you have to. and also even if
you don't)

::: a character on multiple sitcoms that is essentially the same in
many traits but has a different name and/or context. copyganger?

::: (As is her talent, this is a narrative request.  I turn the mic
over to the esteemed Anya):
"" Two or more people have limited knowledge of a situation. By
talking they pool their limited knowledge and discover something
entirely new.
(Adam says a similar situation occurs in cryptography where it's
possible to split a key up amongst several people, such that the code
can be cracked only when they all agree).

Here's my example: A Francophone Montrealer came with us to Jazzfest.
He noticed that there was a Fais-Do-Do Tent.

"Why do they call it that?" he said, explaining Fais Do-Do is French
baby talk for "go to bed" (fais dormir).

"Well, a Fais-Do-Do is a Cajun fiddlin' party that's davka an
overnight party in the countryside," I said. "But I never knew what
Fais-Do-Do meant! It must be what the grownups say to the kids so they
can keep partying while the kids sleep on the porch."

And so it is! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fais_do-do

Suggestion would be something to do with the blind men and the
elephant. Elephanting?""

(back to aaron) my suggestions would stem from the concept Adam
identified, which is "secret-sharing".  one popular method to
implement secret-sharing is by fitting a curve to N points, each of
which is known by just one of the collaborators, and may be a subset
of the total number of points distributed (so you don't need everyone
from the set, just a sufficient number).  the N points of that subset
are together called the "Reconstruction Set".  Therefore, my
suggestion for naming this definition is to find something along the
lines of "a reconstruction construction," except that particular
phrase is too unwieldy.  Have at it!!


okay.  that's enough for now, i guess.
