<blockquote>

But nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all 
your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than to keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your 
distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up!

<p/>

To be sure, we shall choose those who are far as possible free from strong desires; for vices spread insidiously, and those nearest to hand are 
assailed and damaged by contact with them. It follows that, just as at a time of an epidemic disease we must take care not to sit beside people whose 
bodies are infected with feverish disease because we shall risk ourselves and suffer from their breathing upon us, so in choosing our friends for 
their characters we shall take care to find those who are the least corrupted: mixing the sound with the sick is how disease starts.

<p/>

... you must especially avoid those who are gloomy and always lamenting, and who grasp at every pretext for complaint. Though a man's loyalty and 
kindness may not be in doubt, a companion who is agitated and groaning about everything is an enemy to peace of mind.
