    Hi!

    If this is the first time you're getting this email, here's the deal:
        This is a list of all the words I've newly enjoyed in the past
        six months or so, plus some other timely stuff related to words.

    If you don't want to get this email anymore, let me know.
    I won't be offended.

    You can see all of the previous wordlists here:
        http://aaron.bornstein.org/words/

    You will notice that a huge percentage of these words have people's
        names listed next to them.  Those people sent me words!  This is
        far and away the best part of this whole endeavor.
        Please, send me words!

[][Wordplays]

    [][Unnamed]
        Write down a list of twenty words, each of which is
             semantically unrelated to the previous.

        The game is more fun if you say the words out loud after you
            write each one.

        Time limits are important.

        The game gets more interesting if you close your eyes.

        Advanced version(s):
            Each new word has to be semantically distinct from not just
               the first previous, but also the 2nd most recent, 3rd, 4th, etc.

        I don't know what to call this game.  Do you have an idea?

    - ignostic/igtheist: The theological view that "God" as usually
       discussed is ill-defined, and that questions related to the term 
       are meaningless because, on further investigation, the intended 
       definitions are unfalsifiable. [via shervin f.; c.f. "ehtheism" 
       in the previous wordslist]

    - zugunruhe: "A word I learned yesterday from a bird watcher.  He
       described it as 'like the anxiety of being prevented from 
       migrating.' meaning, the best time to see the most amount of 
       birds is about two days after a major storm, when the zugunruhe 
       is strong within them." [via patrick h.]

       "law-abiding character". It refers not so much to the lawful 
       character or external sets of laws a society might have, so much 
       as the immanent juridicality of societies based on exchange, i.e. 
       the fact that they're permeated top to bottom by concepts of
       property, legal titles, claims, counter-claims, etc."

    [This sounds to me like the Puritanical bastardization of Danish Hygge]

    - mobarchy: rule by the undifferentiated and easily incited
       masses. [via sarah k.]
       "something one seeks to avoid in a govt by the many (democracy)

       values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in

    - quirkyalone: a person who prefers being single to dating for the
       sake of dating.

    - propinquity: "In social psychology, propinquity (from Latin
       propinquitas, "nearness") is one of the main factors leading to 
       interpersonal attraction.  It refers to the physical
       or psychological proximity between people. Propinquity can mean
       physical proximity, a kinship between people, or a similarity in 
       nature between things ("like-attracts-like"). Two people living 
       on the same floor of a building, for example, have a higher 
       propinquity than those living on different floors, just as two 
       people with similar political beliefs possess a higher 
       propinquity than those whose beliefs strongly differ." 
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propinquity

    - panhetaerism: a state of universal sexual promiscuity.

       of twins. [via anya k.]

    - vialis case: a grammatical case of a noun or pronoun that has
       the basic meaning of "by way of". (limited to Finnish, Estonian, 
       Eskimo-Aleut languages, and arguably
       Basque?)
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vialis_case [via tristan u.]

    - asseveration: The solemn or emphatic declaration or statement of
       something.

       not bad', 'he was not unattractive', etc) [via kelly c.]

    - Wabi-Sabi (Japanese): the beauty inherent in something's imperfection or

    - superbfluous: excellent... but extra [by amanda b.]

[] [Lackinglogisms: Definitions that need words]

   - The satisfaction felt upon retrieving the word at the tip of your tongue.

   - The sensation felt when you've been looking for something and it's 
     on your body or exactly where you'd expect it, e.g. "my 
     glasses are on my face!"

   - When you want someone to be trolling but aren't sure if they are.
        "troll-jecting" / "trojecting"
        "spellcasting" / "wishing on a troll" / "trollhope" [natasha l.]


    - knowing everything about nothing but still contemplating that. 
      [nathan w.]

    - the ineffective over reaction to something whose perceived threat 
      is far greater than its actual threat, in part because its 
      perceived importance is far greater than its actual importance, 
      e.g. taking shoes off at the airport to make people feel safer 
      despite that no plane has ever been blown up by a shoe bomb, 
      posting guards outside schools to prevent school shootings to 
      appease parents, most of politics posturing when something bad 
      happens, general operation of bureaucracy/ass covering.
      We could only come up with "inefficacious hyper-pacification".
      [tristan u. and jane p.]

      Candidates: "security theater" - 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater

    Suggestions for previous lackinglogisms:
    - "The inability to decipher emoticons"
        - apaglyphic, apatheoretic, digital prosopagnosia [jane p.]
        - punc't -- cf. punk'd, the ashton kutcher show that depended on 
          celebrities' misinterpretations of rigged events for humor. 
          (from "punctuation," which is of course the major constituent 
          of most emoticons.) [shervin l.]

    - "An auditory palette cleanser" 
       - "sound swab", both noun and verb, e.g. I got, like, totally 
         sound swabbed by the silence; let's go for a sound swab before 
         we listen to this next track. [leekai w.]

    - "An item (song, object, etc) that sparks reminiscence the very
      first time you experience it (ie the sensation of 'deja new')"
        - syntemperpoeia [kelly c.]

    - "someone who can't figure out common acronyms in texts"
        - iluded ("ILU" + "deluded.") [shervin f.]

[] [Itinerant Idioms: A guest section, contributed by Tristan U.]

    1)  "As innocent as freshly laid eggs."  from Hindi, self-explanatory.
    2)  "It doesn't go." from German, a herald of German rigidity and
        in use as a way of saying that something cannot even be 
        conceived as being possible (even though it is often reasonably 
        possible).
    3)  "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down." from Japanese,
        a common saying that engenders Japan's pervasive, if not 
        unhealthy, relationship with conformity.


    A story from Kelly C that I think fits best in this section:
    ""
    Here's a kind of strange little etymology I learned at SfN this
    year--so the whole city [New Orleans] has the 'who dat' motto, which 
    became part of the everyday vernacular after being popularized in 
    minstrel shows (across all social classes).  At the same time a 
    friend who had served with the peace corps in Sierra Leone was 
    teaching me some words in Krio, a pidgin English spoken by the freed 
    slaves who were brought to colonize Freetown. The Krio word for 
    'who' is 'udat.' Can't be entirely sure which was the causal 
    relationship flows--whether the line in the minstrel show was 
    inspired by a common phrasing made by slaves, or vice versa - but 
    it's quite perverse if it's the latter.
    ""

[][Some words about words]

    I.

    "The world of appearance is a jumble of shuffled sensations ...
     Language is an effective ordering of the world's enigmatic 
     abundance.  In other words, we attribute nouns to reality.  We 
     touch a round shape, we see a little lump of light the color of 
     dawn, a tingling elates our mouth, and we lie to ourselves and say 
     that these three disparate things are but one and that it is called 
     an orange.

    The moon itself is a fiction. Apart from astronomical facts, upon 
     which we will not dwell here, there is no resemblance whatsoever
     between the yellow circle now clearly rising above the Recoleta and
     the thin pink sliver that I saw above the Plaza de Mayo a few 
     nights ago. Every noun is an abbreviation."
        ~ Jorge Luis Borges, "Blather for Verses", from "The Size of
                              My Hope" (1926)

    "Certainty grows when the judgments of perception become simplified."
        ~ Bruno Latour, "The Pasteurization of France" (1984)

    "Words mean something.  You can't just make stuff up."
        ~ Barack Obama, 2008, remarking on Sarah Palin's convenient uses 
          of language. 
[http://thepage.time.com/2008/09/06/obama-to-palin-you-cant-just-make-stuff-up/]

    "No one is reading your emails."
        ~ Barack Obama, 2013, to Charlie Rose


    II.

    "The expressive word does not simply choose a sign for an already
     defined meaning. ... If we want to do justice to it, we most evoke
     some of the other words that might have taken its place and were
     rejected ... and the extent to which this particular word was 
     really the only possible one if that meaning was to come into the 
     world.

    In short, we must consider speech before it is pronounced, the
     background of silence which does not cease to surround it and 
     without which it would say nothing."
        ~ Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "Indirect language and the voices of
                                  silence" (1959)

    "... the main dangers lie in the `unknown knowns' – the disavowed
     beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know
     about, even though they form the background of our public values."
        ~ Slavoj Zizek, "What Rumsfeld doesn't know that he knows
                         about Abu Ghraib" (2004)

    "I told the least untruth."
        ~ James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, on his own
                         Congressional testimony (2013)
