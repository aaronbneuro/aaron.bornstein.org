]]] A. Some words about words

Lately I'm obsessed with the fact that in Spanish [0] the definitional
inquiry - how you ask the meaning of a  word - has what I find to be a
really beautiful property.  The phrase "?que quiere decir?" translates
literally as "What does it want to say?"  "What does it _want_?"  Not
what meaning did you imbue it, but  instead: what meaning does it wish
to communicate?  The passive object becomes the actor, almost an
oracle. Isn't that neat?

My amusement with this has lead to the question: is this (")just(")
whimsical anthropomorphism? Or is there a Whorfian [1] dynamic at
work?  It's fun to read into the fact that this idiosyncratic peer
status for words is found in the mother tongue of the magical
realists, those authors who so successfully explored the corner cases
of laws of  nature and langauge. These authors clearly felt
comfortable in the sentiment that even unfamiliar words could
speak volumes at first encounter. So much so that they would liberally
pepper these novel creations (... discoveries?) throughout their work.

As enjoyable as it might seem to wordplay, this wasn't a game they took 
lightly. They knew you can't just slap a couple of old words together 
and find a new sentiment worth expressing. You have to listen to the 
words. Borges felt so strongly about the care one should take in 
midwifing new words that he famously savaged Joyce's "brilliant but 
failed experiment", Finnegan's Wake, largely on these grounds. His 
critique peaked in the methodical deconstruction of Joyce's extensive 
rap sheet of crude portmanteau, dismissing them as - what else - 
"monsters", linguistic Frankensteins haphazardly slapped together from 
spare parts that served, in Borges eyes, only to suffocate their 
creator's legacy. Reading "Joyce y los neologismos" [2] it's clear that 
the critic is moved to moral outrage, that he sees such reckless abandon 
with words as an abomination - not mere shoddy craftmanship, but a 
perversion of nature. And I have to admit, thinking of all the words, 
new and old, whose common use does not match what seems to me their 
rightful expression [3], I find his outraged rant compelling. If you're 
receiving this email, it's because I think you would, too. So, check it 
out [2].

And, with that, I'll get out of the way and let the words do the talking.

]]] E. FOOTNOTES

[0] ... and perhaps other languages as well (let me know!)

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity

[2] English translation available in this book, "Borges: A reader",
which should be at most
     libraries but is also at Amazon:
     http://www.amazon.com/Borges-Reader-Selection-Writings-Jorge/dp/0525483268

[3] My ready example of this is "nonplussed", which is also an example
of another of my pet
     peeves: a modified form whose root does not itself exist.


okay! send me more words! on nom nom!
