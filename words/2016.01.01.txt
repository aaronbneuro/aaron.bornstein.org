new(to everyone) words:

    oughtput: the desired output of an analysis or process (with the
implication that you have failed to achieve it on multiple occasions). [by
cameron e]


some words about words:

    the nicest thing anyone said to me in 2015 is: "i was disappointed to
see you stopped writing those essays in your words emails." (i paraphrase)

    and yet.

    in the meantime, i encourage everyone to read this, in which burroughs
expands upon his assertion that language was the first virus and outlines a
program of revolutionary countermemetics:
        http://www.ubu.com/historical/burroughs/electronic_revolution.pdf

    ""The aim of this project is to build up a language in which certain
falsifications inherit in all existing western languages will be made
incapable of formulation.""

    or, you could read this summary:
https://seansturm.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/burroughs-on-how-to-escape-the-s=
ociety-of-control/

    either way, it's good stuff.


    until next time.
