[] [Welcome words]

    Hello!

    There is an enormity of Wortschatz below. Hope you're chuffed!

    If this is the first time you're getting this email, here's the deal:
        This is a list of all the words I've newly enjoyed in the past
        six-ish months, plus some other timely stuff related to
        words.

    If you don't want to get this email anymore, let me know - I won't 
        be offended.

    You can see all of the previous word emails here:
        http://aaron.bornstein.org/words/

    You will notice that a huge percentage of these words have people's
        names listed next to them. Those people sent me words! This 
        started happening a few wordlists in, and I continue to think 
        it is the best part of the whole endeavor. 

        Please, send me words!

[] [Table of "content"s]

    Below you will find:

    . Neotomelogisms: The main event! Words that are new to me.

    . Novelogisms: Words that were, as far as I can tell, newly
                   invented by someone I know and/or me.

    . Dissonyms: Words that don't sound like what they should mean, or 
                 vice-versa.

    . Some words about words.

    into halves ad infinitum... or at least until the next meal.
    [via sara c]

mono no aware: (japanese) the ahhh-ness of things. (compare with 
               'Yugen': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugen#Y.C5.ABgen)

Determinativkompositum: (german) a compound (kompositum) in which the 
    first part of the word, the subjugated "Determinans", limits or 
    more closely defines the second part of the word, the dominant 
    "Determinatum". For example sailboat and steamboat and motorboard 
    and boytoy. In the sense they are the boring compounds because they 
    don't create a poetic new, third meaning, but they can be 
    constructed and sound right very easily. The awesome thing is that
    "Determinativkompositum" is itself a Determinativkompositum.

[] [Novelogisms: Making their word debut...]

[These are words I or people on this list have had a hand in creating.]

cruddite: a luddite of anachronistic technology. like someone tech 
          savvy who refuses to use a overhead project [by jane and 
          benchun]

aphojia: disturbance in using and understanding emojis caused by being 
         older than 30.

Facial cue valence blindness: The inability to judge whether, while 
    passing potential mating partners on the street, contractions of 
    muscles near the edge of the mouth and widening of eyes and pupils 
    are “flirting” or “mocking”. [via raphael k]

nigh-fi: communication in person. "i cant get all my thoughts out in 
         text, let's meet at the coffeeshop and get on nigh-fi"

Flirtagnosia: The inability to tell whether anyone is checking out 
              anyone. [via raphael k]

antithet: a self-negating adjective, generally used by marketers or 
          advertisers. While used without irony, its appearance implies 
          the opposite is the case. Examples: WORLD FAMOUS, AUTHENTIC, 
          ALL-NATURAL, GOURMET, IMPORTANT, PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL. 
          "Opening the menu crowded with antithets, Alphonse 
          anticipated a sub-par meal." [by adam b and anya k]
 
menschenverachtend: Literally "despising of humans", it is basically 
    like misogynistic but for humans in general. I think that would be 
    a hugely successful word in English because all the opinion-based
    industry that gets upset at actions people take because of their 
    cultural meaning and then people who get upset and that response 
    etc always shoot themselves in the foot with narrow definitions of 
    what is good for whom. I think its a beautiful sentiment to express 
    disapproval of something with that word. [via raphael k]

logomasochist: someone who likes to be tortured with words. [by amy l]


[] [Dissonyms: Words that don't mean what they should, given how they 
               sound]

    sapid means to have a pleasant taste; it most certainly does not
        sound like a pleasure - no one would want to be described as 
        sapid.

    the formal definition of "enormity" is not just something of a 
        large scale or seriousness or extent. it is in particular 
        something considered /bad (evil) or morally wrong/ of such 
        scale. syn. atrocity or monstrosity. [via amy l]

    chuffed: 
        1. annoyed; displeased; disgruntled.
        2. delighted; pleased; satisfied.
        [via fenna k]

[] [Some words about words]

    A gentleman meets a friend and greets him, shaking his hand and 
    nodding a little.

    Like that, he thinks that he has said hello. But the greeting 
    already exists, and this good gentleman is only putting the 
    greeting on for the umpteen-hundreth time.

    It's raining. A gentleman takes shelter under an arcade. These 
    gentlemen almost never know that they have just slid by 
    prefabricated toboggan from the first rain to the first arcade. It 
    is a wet toboggan of withered leaves.

    And the gestures of love, that gentle museum, that gallery of 
    figures of smoke. Let your vanity console itself: Mark Antony's 
    hand sought what your hand seeks. And neither his nor yours was 
    seeking anything that has not been found since eternity. But 
    invisible things need to materialize themselves, ideas fall to
    earth like dead pigeons. The genuinely new creates either fear or 
    wonderment. These two sensations - equally close to the stomach -
    always accompany the presence of Prometheus. The rest is
    convenience or profit, that which always comes off more or less 
    well. Active verbs contain the whole repertory.

    Hamlet has no doubt: he seeks the authentic solution, not the 
    house door or the road already worn by whatever shortcut or
    crossroads proffer themselves. He wants the tangent that will 
    smash the mystery into smithereens, the fifth leaf on the clover. 
    Between yes and no - what an infinite rose of the winds. The princes
    of Denmark, those falcons who elect to die of hunger before eating
    dead meat.

    When the shoe pinches, it's a good sign. Something's happening 
    here, something that shows us, that in a muffled way places and 
    defines us, which is the reason monsters are so popular and
    newspapers go into ecstacies over two-headed calves. What
    opportunities, what a prospect for a great leap toward otherness!

    Here comes Lopez.

    "How's it going, Lopez?"

    "How's it going, buddy?"

    And like that, they think they have said "hello".

         ~ _How's it going, Lopez?_
           from "Cronopios and Famas", by Julio Cortazar
