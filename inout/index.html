<!--
As neuroscientists, we believe our work has the potential to impact almost every human endeavour.
Therefore, it behooves us to be in contact with as broad a range of disciplines as possible.
-->

<blockquote>
<p/>
The "Inside-Out" seminars bring professors from departments inside Princeton, but outside of Neuroscience, to speak with the PNI community about scholarship that impacts ideas and practices in our field.

<p/>

The first series will feature scholars presenting an incredible range of work: 
how neuroscience impacts and interacts with conceptions of race,
how the notion of "free will" is formulated in quantum mechanics,
how implicit biases can be measured in machine learning models of human language, and what this might mean for how biases are transmitted between humans,
and how concepts of brain organization, from localization to connectionism, have been shaped by - and continue to be shaped by - notions of

<p/>

The four seminars will be held on Thursdays, at 4:30pm, in Room A32, the time and location regularly reserved for Neuroscience Seminars, and will be followed by a reception with the speakers.
